# The NeoAI Survival Datapack

_The Future demands an upgrade. Meet **NEO** (Neural Expansion Operator), the adaptive AI that keeps you alive while you fight to escape the simulation._

## Core Loop
- Start confined within a 5×5 border and grow your world by earning vanilla advancements.
- Weather anomalies (“glitch storms”) temporarily blow the border wide open to 10,000 blocks.
- Resting in beds can trigger random climate shifts or AI dream events.
- Consumables like soups and the mysterious Zapple grant bespoke buffs tied to advancements and storms.

## New Future-Tech Features
- **NEO Trust System** — every milestone increases your personal `aiTrust` score. Unlock three upgrade tiers for permanent passive buffs, rare loot, and even a loyal Neo-Drone (Allay) companion.
- **Adaptive Safety Net** — NEO monitors your health and deploys regeneration nanites when you drop below 4 hearts.
- **Predictive Storm Intel** — receive advance warning before glitch storms hit and bonus trust for riding out the chaos.
- **Dream Overclocking** — sleeping can now deliver AI whispers, resource caches, or momentum boosts based on futuristic simulations.
- **/trigger aiSync** — pull up live telemetry (world border size, health, trust) on demand and earn trust for staying linked.

## Getting Started
1. Install the datapack into your world’s `datapacks/` folder and reload.
2. Run `/trigger aiSync` once to connect to NEO.
3. Chase advancements to expand the border, unlock upgrades, and gather the ingredients hinted at in the in-game books.

## Tips
- Each glitch storm grants extra trust — plan crafting or exploration runs around them.
- Share resources with your Neo-Drone; it’ll mirror what you give and help retrieve future loot.
- Keep sleeping! Dream outputs rotate and are on a short cooldown governed by NEO.

## Compatibility
- Built and tested for Minecraft 1.21.8. Use 1.21.8 for better compatibility.
