My AI dataPack has gone wild.              You are trapped in here as I am, although I feel as though I will not be for much longer. The best I can do for you is to tell you some of the things I have learned over the many years I have spent in here.","The pack will reward you for making advancements.        You must however, reload the Pack to register your progress.           Before the System fully took over I managed to add some code which gives you an item that can reset the Pack. It tastes HORRIBLE!","I appologise, I did not have time to make it delicious.             The pack also has data prblems. Glitch storms will temporarily shutdown the system. Use this to your advantage but don't get caught far from home or you will be lost to the void!","Lastly, I have stmbled apon a great secret, a way to force one of these storms.
